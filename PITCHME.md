using primitive data types to represent domain ideas

+++

+++

## Primitive Obsession is the basis of almost all other smells

+++

## how to remove it?

+++

## introduce many small objects, called ValueObject, that performs small tasks as treatment

+++

## emergent/continuous design as long term strategy

+++

## use the refactoring techniques as tool

+++

## benefits
