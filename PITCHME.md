## Code Smells

---

## Primitive Obsession
using primitive data types to represent domain knowledge

---

## Examples
- double for money
- int for quantity
- ints/dates for range
- array for object

---

## My Conclusion
Primitive Obsession is the basis of almost all other smells

---

## how to remove it?

---

## introduce many small objects
## that performs small tasks
## as treatment

---

## embrace continuous design
## as long term strategy

---

## use refactoring techniques
## as tool

---

## benefits
- More understandable code
- Better code organization
- Composable building block
- Powerful behavior attractors
- Eliminating knowledge duplication

## the best way is 
## by doing a lot of practice
## period

---

## doing your job every day
## doesnâ€™t qualify as real practice

--- 

## Deliberate Practice
The secret is life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain

---

## We need a place and time to experiment and fail spectacularly

---

## This workshop is that place

---

## Mindset
- You are here to learn not to build something, no output required
- Slow down. Don't focus on getting it done, focus on doing it perfectly
- Work in pair. Leverage each other knowledge.
